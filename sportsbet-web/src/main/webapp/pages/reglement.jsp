                    <p>The game takes place during the FIFA World Cup 2018. </p>
                    <p>You have to indicate the score of each game and validate them at least 1.5 hours before the game starts. Only the score at the end of the 90th minutes will be taken in account.</p>
                    <p>If you found the result of the game (i.e. you find the winner or the draw) you'll win 3 points. If you also find the exact score of the game, you'll get a 2 points bonus</p>
                    <p>Finally, if you find the exact score and that less than 10% of the betters found it, you get an extra 2 points bonus.</p>
                    <p>So, with the right result you get 3 points, with the exact score you get 5 points, with the exact score with less than 10% of the betters you get 7 points</p>
